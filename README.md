Control logic description

Simulation tools used (e.g.TrinkerCad. WOKWI, Multisim etc)

4. Implementation

How the model/code is structured

Explanation of main scripts or modules

Git version control and branching strategy (optional)

5. Simulation and Results

Screenshots or graphics from simulation runs

Discussion of performance and behavior
