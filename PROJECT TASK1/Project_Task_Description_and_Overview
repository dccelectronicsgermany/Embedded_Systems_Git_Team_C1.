**Traffic Light System**
 First scenario of a traffic light system
 One line and one traffic light (red, yellow, green light)
 Control the lights with respect to timing
 Use time events like t20 for the presentation of the switching delay
 Model the traffic light system with the following diagrams
 Structure: a class diagram that represents the main structural elements
 State machine diagram for each class
 What are the possible states, transitions, events, …?
 Test all relevant scenarios!
 Use for a fast “drawing” the open draw.io tool
 Develop a simulation for the traffic light control system
 Make yourself familiar with Arduino simulators like Tinkercad Circuits or Wokwi and realize a
 simulation for your traffic light realization
 Use leds as traffic light
 Use an Arduino as μC
 Map the state machine model to code (via switch state pattern!)
 Develop a circuit for leds
 Determine the required voltage, current and resistant of the series resistor
 For the circuit design you can use MultiSim
 Create a private git repository (at github) based on your university mail account
 Upload all relevant models/documents to the repository - > professionally push updates of for
 your models/documents to your repository
